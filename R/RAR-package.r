#' @description 
#' RAR package is designed for simulating most popular response-adaptive randomization 
#' methods in the literature with comparisons of each treatment group to a control 
#' group under no delay and delayed scenarios. All the designs are based on one-sided 
#' tests with a choice from values of 'upper' and 'lower'. The general assumption is 
#' that binary outcomes follow a Binomial distribution, while continuous outcomes follow 
#' a normal distribution. Additionally, the number of patients accrued in the population 
#' follows a Poisson distribution and users can specify the enrollment rate of patients 
#' enrolled in the trial.
