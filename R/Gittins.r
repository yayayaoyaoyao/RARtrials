#' @title Gittins Indices
#' @description \code{Gittins} can provide Gittins indices for binary reward processes
#' and normal reward processes with known and unknown variance for certain discount factors.
#' Binary reward process can handle scenarios with up to 2000 participants in a trial, while
#' normal reward process can handle scenarios with up to 10000 participants in a trial.
#' @details Gittins indices for binary outcomes are generated from \code{bmab_gi_multiple_ab} function from \code{gittins} package with
#' time horizon 100, 100, 100, 1000, 1000 for discount factor 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.99 and 0.995 respectively.
#' Gittins indices for continuous outcomes are obtained by linear extrapolation using Table 8.1 and Table 8.3
#' in \insertCite{Gittins2011}{RARtrials}.
#' @export Gittins
#' @importFrom stats approx
#' @param Gittinstype type of Gittins indices, with choices from 'Binary', 'UNKV' and 'KV'.
#' 'Binary' represents binary outcomes, 'UNKV' and 'KV' represent continuous outcomes with
#'  known and unknown variance respectively.
#' @param df discount factor which is the multiplier for loss at each additional patient in the future.
#' Available values are 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99 and 0.995 for \code{Gittinstype} in 'UNKV' and 'KV';
#' 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.99 and 0.995 for \code{Gittinstype} in 'binary'.
#' @return A vector of Gittins indices for \code{Gittinstype} in 'UNKV' and 'KV'. A matrix of
#' Gittins indices for \code{Gittinstype} in 'Binary'.
