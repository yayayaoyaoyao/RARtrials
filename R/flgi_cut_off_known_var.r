#' @title Cut-off Value of the Forward-looking Gittins Index Rule in Continuous Endpoint with Known Variances
#' @description Function for simulating cut-off values at the final stage using the forward-looking Gittins Index rule
#' and the controlled forward-looking Gittins Index rule for continuous outcomes with known variance in trials with
#' 2-5 arms. The conjugate prior distributions follow Normal (\eqn{N({\sf mean},{\sf sd})}) distributions and should be the same for each arm.
#' @details This function simulates trials using the forward-looking Gittins Index rule and the
#' controlled forward-looking Gittins Index rule under both no delay and delayed scenarios to obtain
#' cut-off values at the final stage, with control of type I error. The user is expected to run this function
#' multiple times to determine a reasonable cut-off value for statistical inference.
#' Considering the delay mechanism, \code{Pats} (the number of patients accrued within a certain time frame),
#' \code{nMax} (the assumed maximum accrued number of patients with the disease in the population) and 
#' \code{TimeToOutcome} (the distribution of delayed response times or a fixed delay time for responses) 
#' are parameters in the functions adapted from \url{https://github.com/kwathen/IntroBayesianSimulation}.
#' Refer to the website for more details.

#' @param Gittinstype type of Gittins indices, should be set to 'KV' in this function.
#' @param df discount factor which is the multiplier for loss at each additional patient in the future.
#' Available values are 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99 and 0.995. The maximal sample size can be up to 10000.
#' @param gittins user specified Gittins indices for calculation in this function. If \code{gittins} is provided,
#' \code{Gittinstype} and \code{df} should be NULL.
#' @param Pats the number of patients accrued within a certain time frame indicates the
#' count of individuals who have been affected by the disease during that specific period,
#' for example, a month or a day. If this number is 10, it represents that
#' 10 people have got the disease within the specified time frame.
#' @param nMax the assumed maximum accrued number of patients with the disease in the population, this number
#' should be chosen carefully to ensure a sufficient number of patients are simulated,
#' especially when considering the delay mechanism.
#' @param TimeToOutcome the distribution of delayed response times or a fixed delay time for responses.
#' The delayed time could be a month, a week or any other time frame. When the unit changes,
#' the number of TimeToOutcome should also change. It can be in the format
#' of expression(rnorm( length( vStartTime ),30, 3)), representing delayed responses
#' with a normal distribution, where the mean is 30 days and the standard deviation is 3 days.
#' @param enrollrate probability that patients in the population can enroll in the trial.
#' This parameter is related to the number of people who have been affected by the disease in the population,
#' following an exponential distribution.
#' @param K number of total arms in the trial.
#' @param noRuns2 number of simulations for simulated allocation probabilities within each block. Default value is
#' set to 100, which is recommended in \insertCite{Villar2015}{RARtrials}.
#' @param Tsize maximal sample size for the trial.
#' @param block block size.
#' @param rule rules can be used in this function, with values 'FLGI PM', 'FLGI PD' or 'CFLGI'.
#' 'FLGI PM' stands for making decision based on posterior mean;
#' 'FLGI PD' stands for making decision based on posterior distribution;
#' 'CFLGI' stands for controlled forward-looking Gittins Index.
#' @param prior_n a vector representing the number of observations assumed in prior distributions, eg: c(1,1) for a two-armed trial.
#' @param prior_mean a vector representing mean of observations assumed in prior distributions, eg: c(0,0,0) for a three-armed trial,
#' rep(0,K) can be used to simplify the process. If a negative effect is expected, adjust the mean to a negative value.
#' @param mean a vector of mean hypotheses, for example, c(0.1,0.1) where 0.1 stands for the mean
#' for both groups. Another example is c(0.1,0.3) where 0.1 and 0.3 stand for the mean for the control and
#' a treatment group, respectively.
#' @param sd a vector of standard deviation in hypotheses, for example, as c(0.64,0.64) where 0.64 stands for the standard deviation
#' for both groups. Another example is c(0.64,0.4) where 0.64 and 0.4 stand for the standard deviation for the control and
#' a treatment group, respectively.
#' @param side direction of one-sided test with the values of 'upper' or 'lower'.
#' @return Value of Z test statistics for one trial.
